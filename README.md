# DV Discord Rich Presence

Shows information about your ***** in your Discord profile so you can prove to your friends that you're cosplaying a Class I railroad.

While using this mod, the following will be shown in your Discord status with activity sharing enabled:
- Your game status, whether you're in the main menu, loading, or idling to rack up playtime~.
- The type and destination of your jobs. Will show "Multiple jobs to various destinations" if you're doing PSR.
- The main type of freight your ***** is carrying.
- If your ***** has a caboose attached.
- The weight of your *****, excluding any locomotives or tenders.
- Your current/last locomotive if you have any jobs active.
- If you have derailed your ***** ~so others can laugh at you, I guess~.

Sorry, I forgot to remove the censor on the word "train" from the original mod description. My bad.
